#DeepFake Face Detection
##Project Overview
This project uses the XceptionNet architecture to detect deepfake movies. The program uses extracted frame analysis and average prediction to categorize videos as real or fake. By using data augmentation techniques and transfer learning from XceptionNet, the detecting system achieves excellent accuracy.

The project supports video frame extraction, preprocessing, and prediction. XceptionNet, known for its superior performance in image classification tasks, helps ensure reliable detection of deepfake manipulations.

##Features
Deepfake Detection: Classifies videos as real or fake based on frame-level predictions.
Frame Extraction: Automatically extracts frames from videos to facilitate analysis.
Preprocessing: Rescales, resizes, and normalizes the video frames for input into the model.
Improved Accuracy: By leveraging XceptionNet and combining frame-based predictions, the system achieves better accuracy than traditional models.
