                    <p className="text-white">
                        We are a bunch of tech enthusiasts who want to make a difference in the real world. We came across many problem statements, but we chose to tackle one that can truly help people. Providing a solution to a real-world problem with technology has never been more crucial. Deepfakes are everywhere, from celebrity impersonations to memes. While creating them can be entertaining, misusing someone's identity is not just a jokeâ€”it's identity theft! We have integrated our specialized technology to tackle this issue using various Deep Learning Models like CNN and Facenet. After extensive research, we found that XceptionNet was the best model for our needs. We trained our model with existing datasets like Face Forensics++ and created our own deepfakes. To our surprise, it took only minutes to replicate someone else's appearance! We also guide users to report any deepfake incidents to Cyber Crime if they discover something suspicious. All our hard work is worth it because we created one of the most effective DeepFake Detectors out there!

                    <h3 className="text-light">Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p className="text-white">
                        Deepfakes refer to synthetic media where a person's likeness is manipulated to create realistic-looking but fake content. This technology poses significant risks, including misinformation, identity theft, and reputational damage. With the rise of deepfake videos, distinguishing between authentic and manipulated content has become increasingly challenging for individuals and organizations alike.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-light">Solution Approach</h3>
                    <p className="text-white">
                        Our Deepfake Detection System utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyze video content effectively. By employing deep learning techniques, our system aims to identify signs of manipulation and provide reliable results to users. The approach includes:
